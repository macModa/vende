## 🚀 Next Steps to Deploy

### 1. Set Up Firebase (Required)
You need to create a Firebase project. I've provided detailed instructions in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`. Quick steps:

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create project: "tunisian-marketplace"
3. Enable Authentication (Email/Password + Google)
4. Add Android app with package: `com.example.tunisian_marketplace`
5. Download `google-services.json` → `android/app/google-services.json`
6. Update `firebase_options.dart` with your project config

### 2. Run the App
```bash
# Install Flutter dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on Linux (for testing)
flutter run -d linux

# Build for Android (when ready)
flutter build apk --release
```

### 3. Firebase Configuration Command
Once you have Firebase set up, run:
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
flutterfire configure --project=your-project-id
```
